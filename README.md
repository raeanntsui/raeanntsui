### Hi, I'm Rae. Thanks for stopping by my GitHub profile!

I was on track to become a Physician Assistant before joining the long journey alongside thousands of other junior programmers a year ago. While I found a sense of accomplishment supporting patients in their medical journey, the repetitive nature of the work began to feel limiting. After much self-reflection and research, I broke into software development. Programming felt like a breath of fresh air. The platform offered me the freedom to experiment with new ideas and continue to challenge myself through code. And like many new programmers, I was faced with moments where I didn't know how to approach the next step. However, rather than quitting from frustration, I began viewing them as valuable opportunities for growth. Bugs and unfamiliar territory were no longer obstacles but invitations to push my limits, improve, and expand my skills. Over time, bugs became less of a hurdle and more of an integral portion for learning. This mindset continues to shape my approach to challenges to help me grow into a more thoughtful and diligent programmer each day.

At App Academy, I became proficient in languages like JavaScript and Python and gained experience with frameworks such as React, Next.js, Redux, Flask, and Express. I've built several projects including clones of Airbnb and Etsy, which gave me valuable hands-on experience in full-stack development. Currently, I am developing a website for a hair salon using Next.js, Drizzle, and PostgreSQL.

Though I haven't yet started my professional career in software engineering, I am always looking for opportunities to learn and become a key contributor to the team. I'm excited to bring my skills, creativity, and positive attitude to the professional setting. Iâ€™m eager to collaborate, contribute meaningfully, and continue growing as a developer!
