### Hi, I'm Raeann! Welcome to my profile.

I am a junior software engineer looking to build on my classroom skills to the professional world. I have a particular interest in building web applications as a front-end engineer however I have developed full stack applications.

During my time at App Academy, I gained a new set of skills in programming languages such as JavaScript and Python, as well as frameworks like React, Redux, and Flask. I also explored the use of AWS (Amazon Web Services) in one of my personal projects. One of my notable achievements is the creation of a website for booking rentals, where I used technologies like Express and React.

In addition to that, I collaborated with other developers to build a clone of Yelp, a popular platform, using Python and React, and we managed to complete it in just one week. This experience enhanced my ability to work efficiently and effectively as part of a team in developing software projects.
